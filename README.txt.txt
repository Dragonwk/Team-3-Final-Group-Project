Shortcoming:
For the
-Fraction Constructor
-reduction-
-GreatestCommonDivisor
-getNum
-getDen
-equals
-add
-multiply
-toString
-realValue
it appearse to us that there is no shortcoming to these method.

For the 
-compareTo
the method test requires us to return a value of 2 for having the passed in fraction
smaller then the fraction it is compared to. This is the only way that we could come
up with that would return a 2.
